          located in the beautiful coastal village of Kosgoda, Sri Lanka. Known
          for its dedication to the preservation and protection of sea turtles,
          the hatchery plays a vital role in ensuring the survival of these

                <span></span>The Olive Ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)
                is a captivating species known for its olive-colored,
                heart-shaped carapace. They exhibit a unique behavior called

                Oceans. Unfortunately, they face significant threats from
                habitat degradation, fishing, and pollution. Conservation
                efforts are crucial to protect and preserve these ancient
